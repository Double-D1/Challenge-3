# Challenge-3

In this challenge I was tasked in making a random password generator

## How it functions
Once you hit the generate password function it will prompt you for what criteria you want your password to have.
As an example it will ask you the length of your password and you choose a number between 8 and 128.
Once you finish the series of questions in the box above the generate button is where the result will be.

## How it looks
